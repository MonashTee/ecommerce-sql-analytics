# E-commerce SQL Analytics

## Project Description
This project analyzes a real-world e-commerce dataset from Olist to 
extract insights about customers, orders, products, sellers, and reviews. 

## Objectives

- Git & GitHub for version control

## Project Structure
- `data/raw/` : original CSV datasets
- `sql/`       : SQL scripts and queries
- `notebooks/` : Jupyter notebooks combining SQL & Python analysis
- `reports/`   : summary reports, visualizations

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Load CSVs into SQLite (notebooks provide the code)
3. Run notebooks for analysis and visualizations

## Key Insights
